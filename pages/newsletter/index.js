                <p>Hey there!</p>
                <p>As a Christian, I've struggled to find ways to live out my faith while doing good work effectively & efficiently. I've learned that being a light requires being equipped well, both spiritually and practically.</p>
                <p>Perusing newsletters, I couldn't find any that addressed these things well, so I decided to make my own.</p>
                <p><a href="https://ericlee.substack.com">Savvy Saturdays</a> is my weekly email newsletter where I share learnings, a curated collection of articles on faith, leadership, & productivity, as well as tidbits of thoughts, verses, and quotes to chew on.</p>
                <p>If you want to learn and be inspired practically, spiritually, effectively, or efficiently, sign up for my free newsletter below!</p>
