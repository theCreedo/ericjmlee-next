                <p>I'm a {getAge('1996-12-21')} year old UT Austin grad (ü§ò'19) with a Computer Science (CS) major and an Entrepreneurship minor.</p>
                <p>I‚Äôve lived in Texas all my life and have a totally normal amount of Dallas pride ‚úä, but Taiwan will always be special to me because it symbolizes my heritage and family üáπüáº. Michigan also holds a piece of my heart since my favorite mission trips were at Ann Arbor and Detroit.</p>
                <p>My Myers-Briggs is <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality">ENFP</a>, and my Enneagram type is <a href="https://www.crystalknows.com/enneagram/type-2-wing-3">2w3</a>.</p>

                <h2 className={utilStyles.headingLg}>Interests</h2>
                <p>My hobbies include biking, writing, reading webtoons & manga, consuming a lot of YouTube, playing basketball, and perusing newsletters as well as stress baking, practicing guitar, working out, and enjoying the occasional video game.</p>
                <p>I'm not too much of a travel freak since it takes up a lot of energy to explore, but friends can usually coerce me into a trip. In general, I like to tell people that as long as I have internet and a laptop, I can be entertained for a while.</p>

                <h2 className={utilStyles.headingLg}>Contact Me</h2>
                <p>I love meeting new people! Sharing about life, helping people on their startups and creative ventures, as well as providing (or receiving) perspective are all life's joys.</p>
                <p>Please reach out if you want to chat! Email me @ <a href="mailto:heyericjmlee@gmail.com">heyericjmlee@gmail.com</a> or message me through any social media.</p>
