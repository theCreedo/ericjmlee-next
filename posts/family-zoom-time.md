I learned a lot during a zoom call with all my family, today.

Weirdly enough, I don’t see my extended family on my dad’s side enough, since most interactions happened before I was born, and most people are 10-20 years older than me.

But anyways, we gathered cause one of my cousins got married, and it’s interesting seeing everyone’s dynamic.

Maybe it’s because my dad is the youngest, but he’s pretty quiet until spoken too. Everyone else in the family is pretty rowdy, puts themselves out there, and talks and is willing to interrupt and risk being interrupted.

My dad though is a listener. Waiting for an opportunity to speak.

I admire the forwardness and openness everyone in the family has, and I wish I could speak more outwardly, but like my dad, I’m pretty silent and passively listen.

I wouldn’t mind talking and asking a lot of questions, but since there can be a lot of voices at one time, I didn’t think it’d be possible or optimal. So I also wouldn’t have mind if, for the whole call, I didn’t speak at all.

I think the biggest takeaway is that if I feel I have a stake in the conversation or great enough reason to speak up, I would. But if not, or if I didn’t see any benefit, I’d save my energy for something else.
