At work, I started to turn my camera on at big company calls 📷 (as in 100+ or all-company gatherings).

It was quite intimidating to do, as most of the people with their cameras on were either managers, super senior engineers, or the main speakers for the call. 😳

The reason I started to do it was because I listened to a podcast that mentioned a perspective to take in order to achieve success. 👀

The statement was:

“_To achieve what nobody has, you must do what nobody else does._”

(_Side note: I was curious about where this quote came from and looked it up. I couldn’t find a quote, but found this [medium article](https://anthony-moore.medium.com/to-achieve-what-nobody-else-has-you-must-do-what-nobody-else-does-b4af0effe8aa) that covers it well - 10/10 would recommend_)

When I reflected on that quote at work, I started to notice things people wouldn’t do (including me). Things like:

- Not willing to turn on the zoom video in group calls.

- Not willing to speak up and share personal stories to connect with coworkers.

- Not willing to [ask for help](https://ericlee.substack.com/p/help-in-humility) when a problem arises, and instead, trying to solve issues oneself.

As I looked at these different obstacles, I noticed the fears related to each one:

What if I turn on my video and people see something wrong with me?

- _What if I speak up and people reject me?_

- _What if I ask for help and look stupid?_

- _What was revealed were many insecurities - a sense of not belonging, rejection, and incompetence._ 😫

But as I dug deeper, I started to see opportunities amidst fears:

- Turning on video allowed people to connect faces to names.

- Sharing about personal life allowed for deeper conversation & connection.

- Asking for help guaranteed a quicker solution - 15 seconds rather than 15 hours.

And with any opportunity, there is potential to grow. 🧐

Gaining confidence, building up courage, and learning to lead amidst discomfort.

“_To achieve what nobody has_” requires **being willing to step out of our comfort zone and stand out**.

To trade safety for risk.

To embrace being different.

The benefits long term vastly outweigh the losses short term.

And so, I wanted to go in that direction of being set apart.

Rather than making big leaps, I’m taking it small - little things like turning on my video in zoom calls, saying a greeting when people join so they feel welcomed, or sharing about my [all-nighter moving experience](https://ericlee.substack.com/p/closing-a-chapter) in happy hours. 🚚

I do it because I want to steward well the little I have, in preparation for much that may be brought in the future. Whether it’s for my future family, for others I care for, or myself.

By stepping up and standing out, my hope is that by doing what no one does, I can achieve what no one has achieved, beyond what I can imagine, for those in my life.
