_What do you do when the world seems to go against you?_

_When the crowded place seems to silence any desire to speak? When you are forced to be something you’re not willing to be? When a divided heart and mind makes things too difficult to bear?_

_What do you do when life seems to overwhelm?_

_When there isn’t enough time or room to breath? When life doesn’t stop for the busyness of life? When the exams, homeworks, projects, quizzes, commitments, tasks, responsibilities, actions, deadlines, stresses, health issues, mental instabilities, pains, lack of motivations and sufferings seem to take priority?_

_What do you do when you want to help but don’t have the capacity to help anymore?_

_When you’re at wit’s end? When you’re spread so thin, there’s not even enough time to help yourself? When the energy you had at the beginning of the semester runs dry, hardens and crackles into a million pieces, crushes to dust, gets blown away, and becomes forgotten forever?_

_What do you do when you have a fear that chokes the soul?_

_When not moving is easier than stepping forward? When running away is better than being surrounded by an invisible wall of anxiety, uncertainty, and stress? When fear itself owns your every action?_

_What do you do when there is no hope?_

_What do you do when there seems to be nothing left?_

_What do you do?_

Oh friend, don’t let those questions be the center of the mind.

That will destroy you. That will control you. That will be your end.

Remember that hope that is in Christ.

Remember that truth that is found by being chosen in the Father.

Remember that when all else seems to fail, that **failing is a worldly perspective, and God is in control.** He has already won over the world.

Please pray.

Pray for the Holy Spirit to be given to you.

Pray for desires and convictions that are in His Will to be rekindled.

Pray for what cannot be let loose by tangible words, but are interceded through moaning and groaning that only the Holy Spirit can intercede on your behalf.

Remember your identity. It’s not found in your present sufferings. It’s found in the future glory.

Remember it.

Believe in it.

Live in it.

Thrive in it.

You were born to be forgotten but you are made known by the Father.

Don’t let your suffering that you go through be wasted. Take it well and remember there is a purpose behind it.

_"Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us."_

_- Romans 5:3–5_

Continue to fight the good fight.

Run the race.

He is for you, not against you. Now live it. Be redeemed.

_Recently, life has been hard. The end of October is the dry season of midterms, projects and deadlines. Additionally my church is preparing for retreat, so many of us students are surrendering a lot of our time this weekend to retreat to Him. And with that, there is a need to cram everything into these next few days as well as for the days after our return._

_I wrote this not only as a mind dump in relation to those things, but for many other reasons — not just for myself, but also for those who may feel these thoughts. Pointing back towards Christ. We are called to preach the Gospel to others, but what is the use of it if we do not preach it to ourselves._

_Anyways, I will leave y’all with a song we sang during our prayer time in our Life Group. This song is a song of declaration of God’s goodness and our dependence in Him._

_I hope you enjoy._

**Verse 1**

_There is nothing like Your love_

_No exchange for all You gave_

_To be welcomed into life_

_So I can know the love it takes_

**Verse 2**

_Now forever to be loved_

_To walk with You for all my days_

_There’s no greater love than this_

_You are the Author and the Way_

**Pre-Chorus**

_This is the sound of the redeemed_

_Rising up to praise the King_

_Our hope is in You_

_This is the sound of the redeemed_

_Rising up to praise the King_

**Chorus**

_Singing glorious glorious One You have saved us_

_Honor and Power and Praise to the Savior._

_You are the Answer You are the Answer_

**Verse 3**

_You come with power come with fire_

_As we lift Your name on high_

_And join with all the saints to sing_

_In bringing Honor to the King._

**Bridge**

_We the redeemed_

_Hear us singing_

_You are Holy_

_You are Holy_
