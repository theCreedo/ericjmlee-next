I finished a book recently called “[Deep Kindness](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Kindness-Revolutionary-Guide-Think/dp/1982163100)”, which introduces a revolutionary way of kindness.

It states that besides the kindness that is used out of respect (like please and thank you), or the kindness that people may post on social media posts, there is a kindness that is deep and permeates the soul.

Unfortunately, the kindness that impacts lives is not easy, and it is something that most people don’t act upon.

The book mentions that there are three potential reasons why deep kindness isn't acted upon; _Incompetence_, _Insecurity_, and _Inconvenience_.

- _Incompetence_ stops deep kindness because of unfamiliarity.

- _Insecurity_ stops deep kindness because of fear.

- _Inconvenience_ stops deep kindness because of apathy.

While reading the book, I couldn’t help but feel deep kindness to be difficult. It is easy to think of excuses and to think of thoughts like:

- “_I’m not competent enough…_”

- “_I have insecurities I’m dealing with…_”

- “_It’s such an inconvenience to my main mission…_” 

But the truth is, what’s lacking is courage.

Through honest self-reflection, we can recognize all the excuses we may have that may blind ourselves from the leap of faith we need to take.

Yes, competence can help.

Addressing insecurities can improve awareness.

And creating more time can reduce inconvenience.

**But ultimately we must learn to care and have courage.**

The impact that changes lives and captures souls requires a willingness to do what isn’t easy and to do what’s right.

For me, even as I write this, I can’t help but know that talking the talk is so much easier than walking the walk.

As the book states:

_"Courage is a choice, not a gift."_

In the moment when action is called, what choice will you make at the crossroads?

Will you choose the easy way out?

Or will you take the courage, to show deep kindness and make an impact?

The choice is yours.

_Questions to ponder:_ 🤔

- _Which area (incompetence, insecurity, inconvenience) is stopping you from impacting lives and showing “deep kindness”?_

- _What is one small way you can take courage to show “deep kindness” this coming week?_
