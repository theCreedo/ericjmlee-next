One of the most difficult things to do as a writer is to get over the hump of writingâ€”the slumps that arise every so often.

There are many tips in order to better handle Writerâ€™s Block.

Some people say to take some time away and let the idea simmer like chili.

Others share that you need to get rest and take a nap, so you have the energy and motivation later.

But one of the best ways to get out of writerâ€™s block is weirdly enough, to just to start writing and to write whatever comes to your mind.

This action does two-fold work.

First, it allows you to get all your thoughts out. Get random thoughts out. Heck, go stream of consciousness.

This allows you to be able to empty your mind of any unrelated thoughts, get the brain juices flowing, and allow a pathway for you to write the words that need to be said.

Secondly, it allows you to have an enormous amount of topics, ideas, and content already written out which you can easily sort through.

Then with all those thoughts, you have the ability to edit down your thoughts, delete anything that isnâ€™t related, or save what you wrote for other purposes.

In other words, **write like a peasant, but edit like a king.**

**Focus on quantity first.**

Your goal is to get as much as you can out, so you have a lot of material to work with.

**Afterwards, focus on quality.**

Remake what material you have into the masterpiece you want to create.

Because the biggest blocker to writerâ€™s block is that you get stuck in your mind and end up thinking more, and executing less.

By writing through writerâ€™s block, even if your content may not be related to the topic, youâ€™re executing & have something to potentially work with, instead of nothing at all.

So go out there, and kill writerâ€™s block.

Remember to write like a peasant, and edit like a king!
