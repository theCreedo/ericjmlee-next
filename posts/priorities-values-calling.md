Every season in life, I find myself needing to refocus on the priorities I have.

- When I was in my “gap year” after college, my goal was to build up skills for entrepreneurship & leadership during my free time.

- When I lost the job I never started, I had to prioritize practicing coding challenges and interview for many positions as a “late techie”.

- When I entered the workforce, I had to focus on growing in my technical understanding of the business & learn all the systems we ran.

Each season brings a new set of priorities.

Recently, I started to **shift my attention from my priorities to understanding my faith calling (a.k.a. values)**.

I listened to a podcast about Career vs Calling, and it pointed out two different types of callings we have - _faith calling & vocational calling_.

- **Faith calling is essentially who you are outside of what you do.** _Things that don’t change even if the season changes. ex. character, values, etc…_

- **Vocational calling is the vehicle to live out your faith calling.** _Things that change season to season. ex. Job Title, Family status, Role, etc…_

In order to understand my faith calling, ironically, I had to analyze my priorities from season to season in order to extract patterns of the things I valued:

- My faith in Jesus.

- My passion for creative ventures and passion projects.

- My value of time & energy (since it’s not a renewable resource), and learning how to manage it effectively.

- My love for leadership and belief that everyone has tremendous influence.

These values gave me clarity towards a bit of my faith calling:

- I feel called to live out the Gospel & Great Commission. To nurture my relationship with Jesus and share it with others.

- I feel called to create amazing ventures and support anyone who chooses that path.

- I feel called to value other’s time and equip people to be effective with their energy.

- I feel called to lead in every moment and empower others to lead where they’re at.

Though this is a rough draft of my faith calling and there’s still a lot to process going forward, I believe this first step will bring about greater clarity of how I choose to live my life - with awareness, purpose, & direction.

_Questions to ponder:_

- _What do you consistently prioritize? What gives you passion and joy?_

- _Why do you do what you do? Who are you outside of what you do?_
