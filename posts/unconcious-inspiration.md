I watched a video recently called “[The Genius of Phineas and Ferb’s Ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5eSZevcyNg)” that covered Phineas and Ferb, a tv show I really enjoyed during my middle/high school years, and I was inspired by it.

If you don’t know, Phineas and Ferb is a Disney show where two bored genius brothers think of crazy inventions during the summer and actually execute them while their sister, Candace, attempts to bust them to their mom.

Personally I loved the show as I thought it was quirky, nerdy, and well-executed, and had a great parallel plot involving Perry the Platypus & Dr. Doofenshmirtz the local evil dad.

Anyways, I was captivated by this video, not because of the genius of the ending, nor cause of the nostalgic throwback (though I enjoyed both of those), but because their sister inspired the boys to create their inventions through her offhand comments. 

You can watch the quoted segment below:

*“I find the idea that Candace keeps inspiring the kid’s inventions based on her throwaway comments like sky high or out of this world really interesting.*

*These are the creations Candace is trying with all her efforts to get the kids in trouble for, but they wouldn't have even been made if it wasn't for her in the first place...*

*__If in a mere throwaway comment she can bring about the completion of an awe-inspiring project who knows what she could accomplish if she refocused herself__.”*

The idea that __inspiration from a few unintentional words__ is powerful.

It reminds me of many bible verses that refer to the power of words from the tongue:

*“The soothing tongue is a tree of life, but a perverse tongue crushes the spirit.” (Proverbs 15:4)*

*“Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruits.” (Proverbs 18:21)*

*“So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great things. How great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire!”(James 3:5)*

There have been many people who have inspired me through their words of encouragement. Words that motivated me to pursue coding, enter into entrepreneurship, and serve as a leader in my church.

There have also been others who have put me down. The most toxic coming from myself. Words that made me doubt myself, question my motivations and heighten my anxiety.

It makes me wonder how have I inspired others, positively or negatively, with my words?

How can I filter what I say to not only better others’ lives, but also my own?

Ultimately, our words have an impact.

They can have a ripple effect on other’s lives.

They can plant seeds of motivation or destruction.

How will you inspire others with your words?
