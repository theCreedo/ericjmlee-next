Words have power. 💪

Motivational speeches, encouraging words from a mentor, or guidance from a leader - they have the ability to inspire, encourage, and influence other’s lives.

But sometimes, actions have more weight than our words.

This is evident when we say we value one thing but act in another fashion.

Like the famous statement, “Follow the money” 💰 , it’s important to look at where our time, money, and talents are going, that way we know where our heart is truly at.

_“For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.”_
_- Matthew 6:21_

For instance, I say a lot of times that sleep is important to me. But looking at where my time is spent, I contradict myself when I get 5-6 hours of sleep, don’t take naps, and consistently stay up late past 1 AM. 😪

It’s questionable if what I say doesn’t align with what I do. Sleep may seem important in my life, but my actions show that I probably value something above sleep. (entertainment, busying myself with work, etc...)

Another example might be someone who says they care passionately about fighting against injustice, but if they’re not spending money, volunteering for the cause, or taking some form of action, it’s a bit harder to believe.

By taking a look at where our actions are, we can know in our current season what we value. Awareness of where our heart lies allows us to assess if we’re living out what we value, and helps us make radical changes in the way we live if we aren’t living out what we say.

_Questions to ponder_: 🤔

1. _What are three things you say you care, are passionate about, or value?_

2. _What actions (time, treasure, talents) do you take in your life that aligns with the things you say? What actions don’t align?_
