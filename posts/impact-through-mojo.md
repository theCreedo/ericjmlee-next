Growing up, I always believed that in order to inspire & create impact, you had to be big or have a position of great power.

This seemed to be confirmed when I entered the entrepreneurial world‚Äîstartups aiming for the goal of becoming $1 billion dollar unicorns, scaling up to have a widespread impact like Amazon, Lyft, Uber, Zoom, Airbnb, etc‚Ä¶

(Also, living in a place that quoted, ‚ÄúEverything is **_bigger_** and **_better_** in **TEXAS**!‚Äù probably didn‚Äôt help)

But that all changed after reading ‚Äú[Small Giants](https://www.amazon.com/Small-Giants-Companies-Choose-Instead-ebook/dp/B000OCXFYC)‚Äù, a book sharing how businesses and organizations choose to be great without becoming big.

These small businesses would be great through the concept of mojo.

**Mojo is that feeling of something different in the air for a group or company ‚Äî of being a part of something bigger than yourself.**

Mojo is what I felt when I went to Trader‚Äôs Joes for the first time, a couple of months ago.

I felt special when I walked into the store‚Äîthe interior design, the way the staff interacted, and the vibe of all the elements in the shop seemed to work together, capturing my heart.

It was a very warm feeling that I wouldn‚Äôt normally feel when I walk into other stores like Walmart, Costco, or HEB (it‚Äôs a Texas thing).

Each item, nook, and cranny of the store demonstrated a well-thought-out brand, that not only said it cared, but lived it out.

Being in a place that counted the cost to care even in the smallest ways brought an experience that I won‚Äôt ever forget.

That is the way of mojo ‚Äî **to impact others not by doing things that scale, but by caring and being real - things that may be more costly in order to impact the clients, stakeholders, and the community.**

This mojo of care is what I strive for in what I do.

This doesn‚Äôt stop logistically doing things by scale or striving to be bigger.

But I am challenged to count the cost.

To recognize that there is no pre-requisite to impacting others‚Äô lives,

**Influence and impact can start now.**

_Questions to ponder:_ ü§î

- _Where have you felt mojo in your life? (organization, community, company, etc‚Ä¶)_

- _What is one way you can start creating impact and influence on others now?_
